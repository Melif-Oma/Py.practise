This repository contains simple Python programs created to **practice using `for` loops**.

The examples focus on:
- Iterating through lists and strings
- Using indexes
- Solving basic logical problems with loops
- Building a strong foundation in Python control flow

This project is strictly for **learning and practice purposes** as I continue improving my Python skills.
